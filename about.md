I'm a web developer who believes that art is in everything that we do.
I'm passionate about education, health (nutrition, psychology, fitness, wellness), and everything to do with performance optimization.
I believe that we are most happy when we are free to express ourselves authentically with those we love, including ourselves.
Remember that the universe has your back.
It gave you life, after all.
