Stress is the root cause of disease.

Overwork is a form of stress.

Another way to look at it is undersleep/rest/recovery is stress.

Bad nutrition is stress.

Over feeding is stress.

Over thinking is stress.

Bad environment is stress.

Bad friends/family is stress.

Not thinking enough will probably lead to stress.
